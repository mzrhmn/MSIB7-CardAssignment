        <p>Dear Istiharah,</p>
        <p>
          On this special day, I wanted to take a moment to celebrate you and
          all the wonderful qualities that make you so amazing. Your kindness,
          humor, and genuine heart bring so much joy to everyone around you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wishing you a birthday as bright and beautiful as you are. Here's to
          many more wonderful years ahead!
        </p>
        <p>With lots of love and warm wishes,<br />[Zakaria Rahman]</p>
